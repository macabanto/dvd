welcome to my notes!

GIT ( by scott chacon ) 
 - Version Control System ( VCS )
 - - System records changes to a [ file / set of files ] over time
 - - so previous versions can be recalled
 - - can see who last made changes to a file

 - Three main States
 - - Modified ( working directory )
 - - - file has been changed
 - - - not yet committed
 - - Staged ( add )
 - - - modified file has been marked
 - - - goes toward commit
 - - Commited ( .git directory / repo )
 - - - data is safely stored in local database
